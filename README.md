# Inverse-Kinematics-Simulations

My first project using openGL for FTC!

This is an inverse kinematics simulation that can simulate a 2 bar arm and spirograph. 
In addition, it uses PID (Proportional, Integral & Derivative) to simulate a real world error prone situation. 

I also created a working model of this here -> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1206315080648495124/1207230332437274624/IMG_7083.mov?ex=679f21dc&is=679dd05c&hm=e0cab0d51cf512f392f4fa2eb0b5025a41ff98422122b2d4edb1fc2203626410&

## Features
