# Inverse-Kinematics-Simulations

My first project using openGL for FTC!

This is an inverse kinematics simulation that can simulate a 2 bar arm and spirograph. 
In addition, it uses PID (Proportional, Integral & Derivative) to simulate a real world error prone situation. 

## Features
* PID that simulates real life
* Editable arm lengths
* 2 Bar Arm System
* Spirograph
